# Fleet Maintenance Prediction & Agentic Management System

## Project Introduction

Fleet management plays a crucial role in transportation, logistics, and large-scale vehicle operations. Unexpected breakdowns can lead to:

- Increased operational costs  
- Delivery delays  
- Safety risks  
- Reduced fleet efficiency  

This project focuses on building an AI-driven Fleet Maintenance System that predicts vehicle maintenance risks using historical vehicle data and extends into an Agentic AI Assistant capable of generating structured and actionable maintenance recommendations.

Our goal is to shift from reactive maintenance to predictive and intelligent fleet management.

# What We Are Building

This project is developed in two major stages:

---

# Stage 1 — Machine Learning-Based Maintenance Prediction

## Objective

Develop a supervised learning system that:

- Analyzes vehicle usage data  
- Predicts maintenance risk or failure probability  
- Identifies contributing risk factors  
- Displays results through an interactive interface  

## Problem Being Solved

Traditional fleet maintenance often depends on:

- Manual tracking  
- Fixed servicing schedules  
- Reactive repairs after failures  

We improve this process by:

- Using historical mileage, engine hours, and fault records  
- Learning patterns associated with breakdowns  
- Automatically predicting vehicles at high risk

## Expected Output

- Maintenance risk level  
- Probability score  
- Key contributing features  
- Basic interpretability insights  

This stage forms the predictive backbone of the entire system.

# Stage 2 — Agentic AI Fleet Management Assistant

## Objective

Extend the predictive model into an intelligent assistant that:

- Interprets vehicle health predictions  
- Generates structured maintenance recommendations  
- Suggests servicing timelines  
- Provides operational insights  
- Handles incomplete or uncertain data gracefully  

## Why Agentic AI?

Prediction alone is insufficient for real-world use.

Fleet managers require:

- Actionable recommendations  
- Service scheduling guidance  
- Clear explanations  
- Structured maintenance plans  

The agent layer adds reasoning capabilities on top of the ML prediction model.

## Structured Output Includes

- Vehicle health summary  
- Maintenance risk assessment  
- Recommended service actions  
- Suggested timelines  
- Operational safety disclaimer  

This transforms raw predictions into practical fleet management guidance.

# Dataset

The system uses a publicly available vehicle maintenance dataset containing:

- Mileage  
- Engine hours  
- Fault codes  
- Service history  
- Repair records  
- Usage patterns  

This enables simulation of real-world fleet management scenarios.
